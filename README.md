Issues:
- Issues with our project include the menu portion not being compeltely debugged. The menu portion has three bugs left over in line 34, 31, and 46. Line 34 having the bug where the return type specification for the constructor is invalid. Line 37 had the problem that data was not declared. Line 46 had the issue where there needed to be a primary expression before ')'. Besides these three errors, the rest were fixed and the other parts of the program are able to be compiled and ran as an executable. The remaining issues have been tried to be fixed, but anything done either does not work or causes more issues in the code. The previous issue from line 9 where char* needed to be char** has been fixed and is no longer an issue.

Challenges:
- Challenegs we faced while doing this project was partially finding times we were free to meet up, but we managed to figure things out and get what we needed to done. Another challenge we faced was debugging the code, and all the errors we got when we tried to compile. We also had trouble figuring out how doxygen worked in the beginning. A challenge we also faced was making the code from scratch without any foundation as in there was no refernce code to look at besides the videos and the basic layout of the menu we were given. Another challenge the code gave was circular dependencies when it came to the load file portion. The final challenges faced was the echo processor and stacking sounds in a loop.

Instructions:
- If anything is needed beyond making the application from this code, the way to build it would depend on what is needed. For instance if the program needed to add something for disabled users, then the code would need to be edited to add settings respective to the user. Such as using the program with just your voice for those who are unable to speak or choose not to speak. If something is needed for a larger consumer audience, then settings for languages or customization would be an option. These additions could be added to the main menu and the user can change their preferences at any time.
